This dashboard helps business leaders answer critical questions such as:
-   How are our total sales and profit margins trending over time?
-   Which product categories and subcategories are the most and least profitable?
-   Which sales territories are top performers, and where are the opportunities for growth?
-   What are the sales figures for the current year compared to the previous year (YoY Growth)?
-   Who are our key customers and what are their purchasing patterns?

### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Showcase

-   **Data Source:** The project uses the official **Microsoft Adventure Works** sample dataset, connecting to multiple tables to build a comprehensive view.
-   **Data Modeling:** A star schema was created in Power BI to form the analytical backbone of the report. This model connects the `FactInternetSales` table with key dimension tables like `DimProduct`, `DimCustomer`, `DimDate`, and `DimSalesTerritory`, ensuring optimal query performance and intuitive analysis.

-   **Data Transformation (Power Query):** Power Query was used extensively for data cleaning and preparation:
    -   Corrected data types for dates, currencies, and numerical IDs.
    -   Merged `FirstName` and `LastName` to create a `FullName` column for customers.
    -   Created conditional columns to segment data, such as categorizing 'Income Levels'.
    -   Removed unnecessary columns to optimize the data model's size and performance.

-   **DAX Measures:** Complex DAX measures were written to create the KPIs and power the visuals.
